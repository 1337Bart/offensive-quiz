Offensive quiz

Run this file using python quiz.py in terminal.
Requirements: Python3

The terminal-run quiz will generate 10 random questions and you have to answer y for yes and n for false.
After each question, it will let you know wheter your answer was right or wrong, and... call you a bitch.

After completing the questions, it will give you a score (x/10) and ask you to play again (unless you score 8+).

If you score below 5 out of 10, it will also insult you.

To play again, simply run python quiz.py again.

Enjoy!
